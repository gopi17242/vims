					<li><p class="bodytext">With field level notification, you can define the appropriate clients and users to notify when a field is changed or when a field equals a defined value. The notification is based on changes to a field on an Issue/document. For example, you can automatically notify the QA team or client when the status of an Issue is resolved or notify the user to whom you allocated the issue to for resolution. </p></li>
					<li><p class="bodytext">Support for external e-mails.</p></li>
				</ul>
